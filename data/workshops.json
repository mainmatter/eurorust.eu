    "description": "Async Rust is a very powerful abstraction for concurrent systems. It is being used extensively in web development for its ability to handle many thousands of concurrent requests at a time. As an abstraction, though, async Rust is quite a brittle one. Many of its footguns and complications often need to be learned the hard way.",

This workshop will focus on expanding your Rust testing toolkit, going beyond the basic techniques you're already familiar with. At the end of the session, you'll have a strategy to test most of the scenarios that are relevant for a complex Rust application.",
