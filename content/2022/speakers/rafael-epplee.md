  bio: "<p>In my decade of professional web development experience, I started in JavaScript, PHP and Clojure, then eventually discovered Elm and Haskell, which lead me to Rust. After many side projects, I am lucky to work with it in my day job now.</p><p>I’m obsessed with developer experience, and think that Rust combines an excellent type system, tooling and community, resulting in an experience that’s hard to find elsewhere. I’ve poured lots of thought and experiments into leveraging Rust’s advantages to further extend this experience to testing.</p><p>I love making games, websites and desktop apps, always putting the user first. When I’m not coding, I’m hiking with my dog or making electronic music.</p>"
