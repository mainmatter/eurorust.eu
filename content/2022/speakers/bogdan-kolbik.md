  bio: "<p>I develop discrete optimizers at MOIA. Using Rust since about a year ago with a background of algorithm development and functional programming. My university diploma says that with a soldering iron, I can turn a pile of transistors into a soviet computer and write an assembler for it. Never tried it, but now I’m careful with the term “Full Stack Developer”.</p>"
