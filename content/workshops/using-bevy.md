  abstract = "Building interactive data visualizations in Rust can be a daunting task... Let's see how Bevy, a data-driven game engine, can help us! From building interactive dashboard to spatial and temporal data visualization, or just Computer Assisted Design, Bevy can be the solid (and fun!) foundation of your next application. This workshop will teach you Bevy basics through non game applications, and a few advanced rendering techniques, so that you're ready to tackle those challenges!"

    <li class="mb-7 border">
      <h4>1. Introduction to Bevy and its ecosystem</h4>
      <div>
        <p>Bevy is a game engine based on an ECS. What does it mean, and how can that work for us? We'll go through the theory behind Bevy, its strong points, its modularity and how its able to target almost every platform.</p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li class="mb-7 border">
      <h4>2. Building an Infotainment Dashboard</h4>
      <div>
        <p>We will go hands on with Bevy, starting from the basics and using its built-in features to build a car dashboard, showing information like current speed, tire pressure, music being played, ...</p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li class="mb-7 border">
      <h4>3. Time Series Visualization for Home Automation and IoT</h4>
      <div>
        <p>Starting for data as time series from IoT devices, we will build digital twins and explore how to display them in an house rebuilt in engine, and add extra features like displaying graphs, starting a rule engine, and why not exploring time travel.</p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li class="mb-7 border">
      <h4>4. Point Cloud Viewer</h4>
      <div>
        <p>From the LIDAR data of a car, we will display the point cloud, and try to make sense of all the data from different points of view, switching between the car and a top-down view.</p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li class="mb-7 border">
      <h4>5. Medical Imaging</h4>
      <div>
        <p>DICOM is a standard format for medical imaging. We will display someone's internal organs using volume rendering and look at them from every angle. Maybe try our hands at some virtual surgery?</p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li class="mb-7 border">
      <h4>6. Uses in the wild</h4>
      <div>
        <p>We will finish by showcasing a few examples of how Bevy is used by companies outside of the game industry.</p>
