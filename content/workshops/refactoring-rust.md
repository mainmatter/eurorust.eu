<p>
	Rust is undeniably syntax-heavy. There’s a lot of intent to express, and Rust wants you to be explicit. All the extra effort can result in bloated code and hard-to-use APIs. Especially features like the trait system, error handling, and ownership add another layer of complexity that can't be controlled by the usual refactoring techniques we have been teaching for the last decades.
</p>
<p>
	In this hands-on workshop, we refactor a Rust program that has just left the prototyping stage into code that is a delight to read and follow, easy to use, easy to maintain, and that plays along nicely with the ecosystem. We take a real-world program and refactor it piece by piece. As a last step, we will write a new feature for both the original and the refactored version. The comparison will amaze you!
