Whether that’s for suitcase-sized hackathons, aerodynamic simulation systems, or designing and constructing prototypes for drone nose modules, Jolyon is the person people go to first.<br /><br />Previously spending most of his time building databases in Java, Jolyon’s first encounter with Rust was when he joined Helsing. Since then, it has become his daily driver - using it to build simulators for systems-of-systems, flight mechanics, web-services, and silly hackathon projects.<br /><br />If you want to know more about what Jolyon does <i>outside</i> of Helsing, ask him about trapeze, baking, or Spirit Island." }

In this workshop, you’ll be combining computer vision, control theory, and a healthy dosage of Rust, to play a Helsing-edition of Simon-says, using real cameras and vehicles!<br /><br />Every 30 seconds, the server will issue a new command - who can get their vehicle into the targeted quadrant the fastest?"
