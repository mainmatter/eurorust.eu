  abstract = "Curious how to make your Rust applications faster and more efficient? In this 30-minute hands-on workshop, we’ll explore what continuous profiling is, why it matters, and how it goes beyond traditional profiling. Using real Rust examples, you’ll learn to capture On-CPU, Off-CPU, and heap memory profiles, tackle advanced scenarios like thread-level analysis, and even correlate profiles with distributed tracing data. Walk away with practical techniques to unlock deeper insights into your Rust applications’ performance."
