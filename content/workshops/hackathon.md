  abstract = "In this workshop/hackathon, you will work in small teams to build a control system (eg, think PID controller) for navigating a virtual quad copter. Each team builds a stand-alone Rust application that interfaces with the simulation server over RPC; a live leaderboard indicates how well you are doing compared to the other teams. The are, of course, no limits to algorithm creativityâ€¦ or maybe you want to build your own simulator and train a genetic algorithm or reinforcement learning agent? Join the workshop and show us what you got!"

      We assume that attendees can write simple Rust applications, but no more specific pre-existing knowledge is required. If you want a head start, look at gRPC and PID controllers.
