      <h4>Session 1. RustRover Demo</h4>
      <div>
        <strong>Time: 11:00–11:30</strong>
        <p>In this session, we’ll explore the key features of RustRover, JetBrains’ dedicated Rust IDE. We’ll cover its support for writing code (including context-aware completion and generation, on-the-fly analysis with quick fixes, smart refactorings, live templates, and more), dependency management (enhanced Cargo.toml editing, unused dependency detection, Cargo features support, etc.), debugging, AI-assisted development, web and database development, VCS integration, teamwork, and beyond.</p>

      <h4>Session 2. Debugging Rust Code in RustRover</h4>
      <div>
        <strong>Time: 11:45–12:15</strong>
        <p>Let’s dive into the RustRover debugger. We’ll begin with a general overview of native code debugging – from generating debug information with the compiler to using it while running code under the debugger. Next, we’ll look in detail at different ways to step through code (step-by-step execution, breakpoints, run-to-cursor, and more) and examine the current state of a program. We’ll then briefly touch on remote debugging techniques. Finally, we’ll see how RustRover leverages the gdb and lldb console debuggers, and how you can interact with them directly within a RustRover debugging session.</p>

      <h4>Session 3. Hands-On with Advanced Rust Types</h4>
      <div>
        <strong>Time: 14:00–15:00</strong>
        <p>This is a hands-on session on advanced Rust type system features. Bring your laptop, clone the provided repository, and dive into challenging exercises covering advanced enums and pattern matching, trait bounds and generic constraints, associated types (including GATs), higher-ranked trait bounds, and more.</p>

      <h4>Session 4. JetBrains Junie: Autonomous AI Agent in RustRover</h4>
      <div>
        <strong>Time: 15:15–15:45</strong>
        <p>Junie is an autonomous AI coding agent available in RustRover. In this session, we’ll explore how it works and how it can boost developer productivity. We’ll also look at the broader role of AI coding agents in modern software development workflows: how they can assist with routine tasks, explore codebases, accelerate prototyping, suggest improvements, and even help teams maintain higher code quality. By understanding Junie’s capabilities in context, you’ll see how AI-powered assistance fits naturally into the daily life of a Rust developer and complements traditional IDE features.</p>
