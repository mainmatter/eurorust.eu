  abstract = "We’ve all heard that “premature optimization is the root of all evil.” But sometimes the real evil is ignoring performance until it’s too late. In this hands-on workshop, you’ll practice spotting and fixing slowdowns in your Rust code.<br/><br/>We’ll move through short cycles of measuring, experimenting, and improving, each with a playful competitive angle to keep things engaging. The goal is to learn first and foremost, but racing for the fastest solution always adds some fun. You’ll walk away with sharper instincts, practical techniques, and a better sense of when performance work stops being premature and starts being essential. Along the way, you’ll also build instincts for spotting bottlenecks and gain hands-on experience with the tools that help decide where to optimize."

      <h4>1. Kick-off & Setup</h4>
      <div>
        <p>Introduction to the workshop goals and the “premature vs essential” debate. Walk through the benchmarking setup so everyone can measure consistently and compare results fairly (e.g., using the same inputs, environment, and tools).</p>
        <p>Length: 30 minutes.</p>

      <h4>2–5. Themed Optimization Rounds</h4>
      <div>
        <p>Each round explores a different performance theme and follows the same structure:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Short theme presentation</li>
          <li>Hands-on optimization challenge</li>
          <li>Compare and discuss results</li>
          <li>Explanation of effective strategies</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Length: 4 × 45 minutes.</p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li class="mb-7 border">
      <h4>6. Final Challenge & Competition</h4>
      <div>
        <p>Participants take on a larger Rust codebase to optimize. The goal is to achieve the fastest correct solution by applying techniques introduced in earlier rounds.</p>
        <p>Length: 60 minutes.</p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li class="mb-7 border">
      <h4>7. Wrap-up & Takeaways</h4>
      <div>
        <p>Review the competition results, highlight the most impactful optimizations, and distill the key lessons. Participants leave with sharper instincts, practical techniques, and a clear sense of when performance work stops being premature and becomes essential.</p>
        <p>Length: 30 minutes.</p>
