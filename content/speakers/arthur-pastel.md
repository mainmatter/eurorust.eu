  bio = "<p>Hi, I’m Arthur, a software engineer based in Paris 🇫🇷🥖</p><p>I worked as an engineer in a few tech companies over the past years and started with Rust two years ago. I’m also passionate about (too??) many other software fields.</p><p>Two years ago, I founded CodSpeed, a Continuous Performance Analysis solution helping tech companies and Open-Source projects prevent performance issues during development instead of waiting until the production breaks to start working on optimizing. We’re already helping some big open-source projects optimize their performance continuously and hope to continue contributing to an overall faster ecosystem ⚡️</p>"
