  bio = "<p>Hi, I’m Arthur, a software engineer based in Paris 🇫🇷🥖</p><p>I have worked as an engineer in a few tech companies over the past few years and started with Rust 3 years ago. I’m also passionate about (too??) many other software fields.</p><p>Two years ago, I founded CodSpeed, a Continuous Performance Analysis solution that helps tech companies and Open-Source projects prevent performance issues during development, rather than waiting until production breaks to start optimizing. We’re already helping some big open-source projects optimize their performance continuously and hope to continue contributing to an overall faster ecosystem ⚡️</p>"
