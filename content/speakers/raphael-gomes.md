  bio: "<p>I am a Mercurial core developer, release manager and steering committee member.</p><p>I like working on tooling and improving performance, and get really grumpy about slow user interfaces. I’ve been coding in Rust for a few years now, and I really like what the language is doing to my brain and for software engineering as a whole.</p><p>I love discussing anything with people, not just software. Come talk to me by all means!</p>"
