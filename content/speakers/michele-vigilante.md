  bio = "<p>My name is Michele Vigilante, based in Vienna Austria and am 31 years old. I am employed as a software engineer at a HR tech company where I have been for the past 6 years. Currently I am in the role of staff engineer for a programmatic ad-tech application, supporting the various teams with architectural decisions and teaching software development using Rust. I am very passionate about Rust and have been follwing the development of the language and its ecosystem since around 2018 however I didn’t start using it in a professional context until 2022.</p><p>I started out in application development at a software automation company using C/C++. After that I worked as a developer for a SaaS startup using functional Scala which was eventually aquired by my current employer where I decided that I wanted to change domains. For the past 3 years I have been focused on learning about the domain of data engineering as it was quite interesting to me and I got to work with Sebastian Magri who is a long time member of the Rust community.</p><p>I am also currently building and maintaining an open source framework that tries to bundle all of the knowledge i’ve aquired over time called Aqueducts. Initially just a toy project it ended up being used quite heavily in multiple teams at my company.</p>"
