  bio = "<p>Line Follower robots are fun.</p><p>What they do is very simple (they follow a line drawn on the floor), but doing it fast to win a competition is tricky. In this case, to add spice to the challenge, the robot must be built entirely out of Lego parts, including all the electronics!</p><p>In this talk we’ll see what kind of algorithms can be used to control the robot, and how detailed telemetry is essential to understand its behavior.</p><p>We’ll also see how using embedded Rust and implementing our own async runtime can make the software easier to understand and at the same time more performant.</p>"
