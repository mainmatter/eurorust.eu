Jon is a Principal Engineer at <a href="https://helsing.ai/?utm_source=eurorust" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Helsing</a> and the author of <a href="https://rust-for-rustaceans.com/?utm_source=eurorust" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rust for Rustaceans</a>. Before that, he owned the internal Rust build infrastructure at AWS. He is passionate about teaching (Rust and otherwise) and has published Rust live-coding and <a href="https://youtube.com/@jonhoo?utm_source=eurorust" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">educational videos</a> since 2018. He also co-hosts <a href="https://rustacean-station.org/?utm_source=eurorust" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the podcast Rustacean Station</a>. Jon started with Rust in 2015 when he built what eventually became <a href="https://jon.thesquareplanet.com/papers/phd-thesis.pdf?utm_source=eurorust" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his PhD thesis at MIT</a> â€” a fast SQL database built from scratch in Rust. Outside of the world of programming, Jon is a Storyteller for the social deception game <a href="https://bloodontheclocktower.com/?utm_source=eurorust" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blood on the Clocktower</a>, and otherwise mostly sits around waiting for the next Rust conference.
