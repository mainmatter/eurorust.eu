As a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.meta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meta</a> I was a part of the first large Rust project at Meta and a state-of-the-art source control server. I've encountered "impossible" runtime issues in a heavy async environment and debugged segfaults in async C++/Rust FFIs. In my work-life I’m a big advocate for quality and reliability and like to dig deep and understand how things work. My free time though I spend hiking and sword fencing.
