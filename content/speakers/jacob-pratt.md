  bio = "<p>I maintain a foundational library in the crates.io ecosystem, have contributed to both the Rust compiler and standard library on multiple occasions, have authored multiple RFCs, received a fellowship from the Foundation, and have worked at companies (using Rust!) ranging from a small startup to Tesla.</p><p>In this time I have worked on codebases as large as (approximately) one million lines of code, bringing existing code up to Rust standards when it wasnâ€™t already, enforcing standards and idioms, and teaching others what should and should not be done, explaining why along the way.</p>"
