  bio = "<p>Hi, I'm Muskan. I was a founding engineer at Vibinex with 3+ years of production Rust experience, specializing in performance-critical Git analysis systems. Working in a lean 3-person startup, I gained deep hands-on experience building data processing systems that handle complex repository analysis at scale.</p<p>My Rust journey began out of necessity. When Python couldn't deliver the performance our enterprise clients demanded, we dove deep into Rust to build our core Data Processing Unit. At Vibinex, we designed privacy-first architectures requiring zero-copy processing and custom memory layouts that directly contributed to closing enterprise deals. My expertise also spans Next.js, TypeScript, React, and Python.</p><p>I'm currently on a break and actively contributing to Gumroad's codebase. I live in Udaipur, Rajasthan. Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, exploring different cultures, theatre, ultimate frisbee, singing, music, badminton, and taking care of stray cats and dogs.</p>"
