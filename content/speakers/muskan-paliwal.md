  bio = "<p>I’m a founding engineer with 3+ years of intensive Rust experience in production environments, specializing in performance-critical systems and enterprise-grade solutions.</p><p>As the founding engineer at Vibinex, I led the technical development of Git analysis tools where Rust became essential for the performance requirements we needed to meet. Working in a lean 3-person startup, I gained deep hands-on experience with Rust’s performance characteristics while building data processing systems that handle complex Git repository analysis at scale.</p><p>My Rust journey began out of necessity – when Python couldn’t deliver the performance our enterprise clients demanded, I dove deep into Rust to build our core Data Processing Unit. This experience taught me not just how to write Rust, but when and why unsafe optimizations become critical in real-world systems.</p><p>At Vibinex, I designed and implemented privacy-first architectures that required zero-copy processing and custom memory layouts to meet both performance and security requirements. These solutions directly contributed to closing enterprise deals where performance wasn’t just nice-to-have, but a fundamental requirement.</p><p>My background spans full-stack development, having migrated our entire platform from Python to Next.js while architecting PostgreSQL systems for complex query performance. This broad perspective helps me understand when Rust’s performance benefits justify the complexity, and when they don’t.</p><p>Coming from a conservative family in Rajasthan as the first daughter to pursue computer science, I’ve learned to prove my worth through practical results. My approach to unsafe Rust reflects this same pragmatism – it’s not about pushing boundaries for the sake of it, but about solving real problems that safe abstractions can’t handle.</p><p>I’m passionate about sharing practical knowledge that helps other developers make informed decisions about when to cross the safety boundary, and how to do it responsibly in production systems.</p>"
