Nikolai Vazquez began poking at the edges of Rust in 2017 and has since then developed a variety of cursed ways to use it, such as his Static Assertions crate. Nikolai’s career has spanned the entire stack, from web/mobile UIs to databases to reverse engineering assembly. When he’s abstaining from software, you can find Nikolai designing graphics, playing jazz piano, dancing lindy hop, or practicing Español and Deutsch.
