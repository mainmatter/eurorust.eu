  bio = "<p>I’ve been on the compiler team for almost 3 years and contributed to every part of the compiler from the parser to linking. Additionally, I’m a member of the libs contributors team and have reviewed many PRs to the standard library. My most famous work in rustc was the improved cfg error messages added in Rust 1.72.0. As an active member of the Unofficial Rust Community Discord I frequently help other Rustaceans with all kinds of questions.</p>"
