  bio = "<p>I am a Senior Backend Software Engineer with 8YoE focused mostly on Rust and Go. I obtained my Master’s in Computer Science with a focus on Evolutionary Algorithms. I love delving deep into underlying tech, and finding out how the small pieces interact to give us the services we enjoy. I just got an 8-string guitar so I can dive head-first into Progressive Metal. I don’t see the hype in coffee but have recently discovered the wonder that is Iced Matcha, and will under no circumstances not tolerate any disrespect to. TABS (in the tabs v spaces war).</p>"
