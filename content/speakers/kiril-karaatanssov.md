  bio = "<p>With 27 years in software engineering, Kiril Karaatanssov has evolved from R&D leadership to architecting APIs at scale. At VMware (now Broadcom), they modernized SOAP-to-JSON for vCenter’s API, authored VMware’s internal REST standard (2016), and shaped SDKs across Java, Go, Python, and Rust. A former CMMI-certified instructor and Scrum leader, they’ve trained teams in process excellence and lectured at Sofia University. Today, they’re obsessed with taming legacy APIs in Rust—slashing compile times by 90%—while capturing the world’s beauty through their camera lens.</p>"
