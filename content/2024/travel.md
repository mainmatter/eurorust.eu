<h3 class="mb-3 mt-7">To Vienna</h3>
<div class="box text-centered">
  <p>Vienna is well reachable via train from many cities in Europe. Also, Vienna is the central hub of ÖBB's extensive network of sleeper trains. If you're looking for an eco-friendly way to travel to EuroRust, check out the <a href="https://www.nightjet.com/en" target="_blank">nightjets</a>. <strong class="nightjet-warning">Make sure to book early though – nightjets tend to be fully booked months in advance!</strong></p>
  <br>
  <p>If there's no good train connection from the place you're traveling from or you're looking for a more price-conscious alternative, there are buses as well, e.g., via <a href="https://www.omio.com/buses" target="_blank">Omio</a>.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Vienna also has an international airport, <a href="https://www.viennaairport.com/en" target="_blank">VIE</a>, if you'd rather fly in.</p>
