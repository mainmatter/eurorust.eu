  description = "<p>Procedural macros are often seen as one of the most challenging things to learn in Rust. At the same time, they have immense utility and are ubiquitous in the language and crates, making basic familiarity with them very desirable. This talk presents the outlines of what these macros are, the different types, how they work, when to use them, and how to write your own. After a bit of theory and a lot of talking, we will do some live coding and write a derive macro that simplifies working with (AWS) SQS.</p>"
