  description = "<p>The terminal is essential for every programmer when it comes to productivity and efficiency. Leveraging text-based user interfaces (TUIs) in the terminal is a powerful way to take full advantage of this environment. And what could be better than using a highly performant systems programming language like Rust to build TUIs?</p><p>This talk aims to demonstrate how the terminal experience (TX) can be enhanced with TUIs and provides an introduction to building them using Rust with the Ratatui library.</p><p>The following points will be addressed:</p><ul><li>What is a terminal user interface (TUI) and why is it used?</li><li>What is Ratatui and how does it work?</li><li>What are the main concepts and main design patterns used in Ratatui?</li><li>What does the future hold for TUIs in Rust?</li></ul>"
