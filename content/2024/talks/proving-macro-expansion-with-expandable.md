  description = "<p>Macros are a very powerful Rust feature. They allow developers to quickly and easily build domain-specific languages, with no runtime cost.</p><p>However, the Rust compiler does surprisingly few checks on macros. For instance, it happily accepts a macro whose expansion is not syntactically valid, which makes them hard to debug.</p><p>In this talk, we will see how <code>expandable</code> allows to check at compile time that a macro always expands to valid code and give a brief explanation under the hood.</p><p>Finally, weâ€™ll see a few techniques <code>expandable</code> uses to generate excellent error messages.</p>"
