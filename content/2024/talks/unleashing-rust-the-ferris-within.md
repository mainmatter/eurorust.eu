  description = "<p>“Let’s rewrite it in Rust” is no longer a party joke. It’s happening! Let me share a couple of stories of learning, appreciating and rewriting stuff in Rust. How we came to love 🦀 Ferris: cargo cult or real need? What is it like to come to Rust from two very different directions: C++ and C#? What are the gaps, the needs, the gems and the tools you should know about? Here’s a real journey and the various experiments leading up towards the success stories at Microsoft. Want to compare notes? Let’s chat.</p>"
