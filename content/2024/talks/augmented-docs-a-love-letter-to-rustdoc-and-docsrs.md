  description = "<p>Docs are one of the superpower of Rust, thanks to the tooling and the central platform hosting them. Let’s take it to the next level!</p><p>After a quick look at some of the most known features of <code>rustdoc</code> and docs.rs, we’ll review the guidelines and explore some of the advanced features available, like interacting with the <code>#[doc]</code> attribute directly or scraping examples.</p><p>We’ll then look at how to enrich the docs with some crates from the ecosystem, like <code>aquamarine</code> for graphs, <code>katex-doc</code> for mathematical expression or <code>document-features</code> for automatic feature documentation, or with some templating, and see how far we can take it to have a complete documentation.</p><p>To finish, we’ll dip our toes into documentation theory, through the Diátaxis framework and the Good Docs Project, check how <code>rustdoc</code> fit in those, and how other tools like <code>mdbook</code> or <code>zola</code> can complement it.</p>"
