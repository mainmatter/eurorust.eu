  description = "<p>Ever forgot something? Thought so. Myself, I forget loads of stuff. I have the remarkable ability of totally forgetting what somebody is talking about during our conversation. It’s not a very useful ability. But you’ll probably also know what it feels like, standing in front of your fridge, staring into the abyss that is the veggie drawer, and pondering on your life choices. Only to remember 10 minutes later that you actually didn’t want to go to the kitchen at all.</p><p>Luckily, we live in 2024. Where just about everything does have working memory. For instance, my laptop does, my colleagues, my wife has a very functional memory it would seem, and so does my car and my neighbour’s doorbell. I figured I want to make that memory work for me. So, being a software developer, a job title that should in my opinion be renamed to ‘computer whisperer’, I went ahead and created a little app that functions as my hippocampus. But then I forgot where I put it.</p><p>This talk is about taking Rust everywhere. It showcases how a single piece of business and communications logic written in Rust can run on anything, from browser to backend, from CLI to bare-metal firmware. And beyond.</p>"
