  description = "<p>Macros are complicated, not only for the developers authoring them but also for the IDEs analyzing them. So how does rust-analyzer, a Rust IDE, actually handle them in a way such that features like completions and usage searching work transparently? In this talk we will explore the mechanism in rust-analyzer that enables these features, the current struggles with it and how both the IDE and library authors can improve the macro IDE experience.</p>"
