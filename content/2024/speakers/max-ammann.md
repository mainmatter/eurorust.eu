I’m an open-source developer and currently work at Trail of Bits as a Security Engineer. This talk is about side project of me, but ToB supports me in talking at EuroRust. At Trail of Bits I audit Rust code on a daily basis.

I am born in Germany and currently live in Munich. I enjoy writing open-source software. I regularly contribute to various open-source projects. I’m also a passionate photographer.
