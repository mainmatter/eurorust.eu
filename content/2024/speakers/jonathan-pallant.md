  bio = "My name is Jonathan, or JP to my friends. I’m @thejpster most places, except where I was late to the party and had to settle for @therealjpster. I’ve been doing Embedded Rust since 2016 and embedded systems since the mid-90s, when I stripped a Commodore 64 and turned it into a line-following robot. These days I am with Ferrous Systems, teaching Rust and offering consulting. Someone once asked me what I’d do if I won a million pounds and I said, uh, probably exactly the same thing I do now really."
