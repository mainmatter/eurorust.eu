  bio = "<p>After getting his master’s degree in Geoinformationscience, Björn joined GiGa infosystems in 2017. Ever since he has been working on software to store, manage and distribute 3D geological data, and almost all of this day to day work involves Rust. When there is time he tries to work on and improve an iOS app that visualizes this 3D data in Augmented Reality. Maybe there will be an opportunity to integrate Rust with the Swift code base as well.</p>"
