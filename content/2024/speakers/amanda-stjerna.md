  bio = "<p>Amanda is a PhD student in Web security at Uppsala university for increasingly broad definitions of \"Web\" and \"security\". She was exposed to Rust during her undergraduate shortly after the group project on making a garbage collector in C where she met her wife. Rust's type-system driven memory management was an easy sell after the experience. She has been working on Polonius on and off since writing <a href=\"https://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:uu:diva-480822\">her master's thesis on it</a> and is currently working near full time alongside RÃ©my Rakic and Niko Matsakis in <a href=\"https://rust-lang.github.io/compiler-team/working-groups/polonius/\">the Polonius Working Group</a> on finishing a prototype <a href=\"https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-project-goals/2024h2/Polonius.html\">on schedule</a>.</p><p>Amanda lives with her wife, a high-energy herding dog and an even higher-energy toddler on the outskirts of Uppsala, Sweden. In her spare time she sleeps or does the dishes.</p>"
