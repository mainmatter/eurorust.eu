  abstract = "Async Rust is a very powerful abstraction for concurrent systems. <br>It is being used extensively in web development for its ability to handle many thousands of concurrent requests at a time. As an abstraction, though, async Rust is quite a brittle one. Many of its footguns and complications often need to be learned the hard way. <br>In this workshop, we will be practising the hard wayâ€”you will redesign async Rust from the ground up. The outcome of this exercise will give you a much better understanding of the abstractions you use on a daily basis, learn the exact reasons behind some of the quirks, and develop your own workarounds for such problems. It will also teach you how to build your own inter-task concurrency mechanisms and even your own specialised async runtimes, should you need it."
