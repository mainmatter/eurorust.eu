  abstract = "In this workshop/hackathon, you will work in small teams to build a control system (eg, think PID controller) for navigating a virtual quad copter. Each team builds a stand-alone Rust application that interfaces with the simulation server over RPC; a live leaderboard indicates how well you are doing compared to the other teams. The are, of course, no limits to algorithm creativity… or maybe you want to build your own simulator and train a genetic algorithm or reinforcement learning agent? Join the workshop and show us what you got!"

      We assume that attendees can write simple Rust applications, but no more specific pre-existing knowledge is required. If you want a head start, look at gRPC and PID controllers.
