During a one-hour cruise on the Seine, let yourself be seduced by the elegance of the monuments and the poetry of the Parisian bridges, in an atmosphere of sharing, discovery and conviviality.<br/><br/>Our expert guides will reveal the capital’s best-kept secrets through stories, anecdotes and lively exchanges. This guided cruise is much more than a simple tour: it’s a true immersion in the history and soul of Paris.<br/><br/>Watch the Eiffel Tower rise above the river, then let your gaze glide over the Grand Palais, the Invalides, the Place de la Concorde, the Musée d’Orsay, the Louvre, the Académie Française, the Conciergerie, Notre-Dame de Paris, the Hôtel de Ville, all the way to the Institut du Monde Arabe. An exceptional cruise, between architectural masterpieces and sparkling reflections on the water."

  <h2 class="mb-7">Syllabus</h2>
  <ol>
    <li class="mb-7 border">
      <h4>1. Introduction to Rust-Python Inter&shy;operability</h4>
      <div>
        <p>We kick off with looking at the advantages of combining Rust and Python, understanding where each language shines and why interoperability is valuable. This module introduces tools like <span>PyO3</span>, which enables Rust code integration within Python environments, and <span>maturin</span>, a library for building, packaging and publishing Python extensions written in Rust.</p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li class="mb-7 border">
      <h4>2. Building Python Extensions in Rust</h4>
      <div>
        <p>We'll continue with the process of creating Python-callable Rust functions, setting up projects using <span>PyO3</span>, and configuring the development environment to handle Rust extensions in Python.</p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li class="mb-7 border">
      <h4>3. Managing Data and Types</h4>
      <div>
        <p>Next, participants will learn how to handle complex data structures shared between Rust and Python, with a focus on type conversions, data ownership, and ensuring memory safety across both languages.</p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li class="mb-7 border">
      <h4>4. Concurrency and the GIL</h4>
      <div>
        <p>The workshop covers Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and strategies for concurrent programming, including async programming in Rust that can enhance Python’s parallel processing capabilities.</p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li class="mb-7 border">
      <h4>5. Creating Python Classes with Rust</h4>
      <div>
        <p>We move on to explore creating Python-accessible classes directly in Rust using <span>PyO3</span>'s <span>#[pyclass]</span> attribute. This module teaches struct definition, implementing methods, and adding Rust-based functionality to Python classes.</p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li class="mb-7 border">
      <h4>6. Static Methods and Inheritance</h4>
      <div>
        <p>The final module details adding static methods to Rust-backed Python classes, along with managing inheritance and visibility in Python environments.</p>
