  abstract = "With its old village look, Montmartre is one of the most filmed areas of the capital. It has always inspired films seeking to represent old Paris and to pay homage to its artists. Amélie Poulain, our common thread, will take you in the footsteps of this rich history which combines painting, cinema and literature with very successful and lesser-known films that we will discover together thanks to the many anecdotes, photos and video clips on tablet. A joyful walk off the beaten track to rediscover the Butte.<br><br><strong>Please be at the location 10/15 minutes before the tour start time.</strong>"
