        <h3 class="mb-4">Built in Rust. Designed for Safety. Ready for Certification.</h3>
        <p>OxidOS is a next-generation real-time operating system (RTOS) engineered to bring safety, modern tooling, and developer productivity to embedded software. Entirely written in Rust, OxidOS is built from the ground up for reliability, security, and portability — and is certifiable up to ASIL D.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>OxidOS solves a significant pain point for regulated industries (e.g., Automotive,Aerospace, Military): accelerating how they build, test & update their Embedded Software.</li>
            <li>We reduce costs & development time by up to 2X for initial development - and up to 4X for updates, new versions, and porting to other platforms.</li>
            <li>We achieve this OxidOS through a Rust-based operating system for safety-critical ECUs, as well development tools that we offer to our clients.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="mb-4">What we do</h3>
        <div class="dashed-border">
            <p>Our approach is based on software-hardware separation (think Docker but for embedded). OxidOS Edge is a Rust-based secure ecosystem for safety critical automotive ECUs with 2 components:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The OS - a Rust-based embedded Operating System for microcontroller-based ECUs;</li>
                <li>Software Development Tools and Support - for fast integration and deployment of Rust-language based software on your specific hardware.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The main advantages of our Rust-based solutions are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Highly modular security-focused Rust-based Embedded OS;</li>
                <li>Can run as a full-fledged Operating System on microcontrollers;</li>
                <li>Capability-based access to hardware - applications only access their designated resources in a firewall manner (credential-based for specific peripherals).</li>
                <li>Excellent code quality - through memory and thread safety that are enforced at compile time.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="mb-4 mt-6">OxidOS Automotive</h3>
        <p>Our solution is perfectly fitted for automotive, targeting both small and large ECUs. It can work as a hypervisor on top of powerful ECUs, or as RTOS for small-size chips, making it the foundation of any software defined vehicle solution.</p>
        <h3 class="mb-4 mt-6">OxidOS - An important actor in the Rust ecosystem</h3>
        <p>We, at OxidOS are a big part of the Rust community, bringing out contribution in the following areas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Our CEO holds one of the board seats in the Rust Foundation</li>
            <li>We are one of the leaders of the Rust for Safety Critical Consortium</li>
            <li>We are contributors to multiple open source Rust-based projects, including Rust-lang.</li>
            <li>Our team is also involved in academia and has ample experience in providing Rust-lang trainings and introdcory course - we recently introduce the first embedded Rust-lang university course in Europe.</li>
        </ul>
