  <p>
    While we're all excited about connecting with the Rust community face-to-face in Brussels, we want to ensure that the event is accessible and attendees remain safe during the two days of the conference. The following safety policy applies to all on-site ticket holders, sponsors, speakers, service partners, etc. If it needs to be changed, we will update everyone via email.

<h3>General Recommendations</h3>

      <p>Please keep in mind that some of our attendees may be vulnerable and not comfortable socializing as before. <span class="highlight">Please respect all attendees' individual wishes on social distancing.</span></p>

      <p>We <span class="highlight">recommend</span> on-site attendees <span class="highlight">to be vaccinated.</span></p>
