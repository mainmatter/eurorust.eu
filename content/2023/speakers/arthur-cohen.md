My name is Arthur Cohen, and I am a compiler engineer at [Embecosm](https://www.embecosm.com). I spend my time contributing to `gccrs`, an alternative compiler for the Rust programming language, and also like to contribute to the official compiler when I can. My other main project is `jinko`, a statically-typed scripted language with a strong functional background and a powerful type system.
