<p>
  The "impl Room" is a space for Rustaceans who want to contribute to the Rust project or to other crates in the Rust ecosystem.<br><br>
  If you're a maintainer, you can use this room to mentor new contributors and help them get started with your project.<br>
  If you're a contributor, you can use this room to get help with your first contribution or to find a project to contribute to.  
</p>
<p>
  All participants will receive a free 3 month <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/?utm_source=eurorust" target="_blank">CLion</a> license valid for personal use from our friends at JetBrains.
</p>
<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
<p>
  We recommend having basic familiarity with Rust. If you're just getting started with the language, we suggest joining <a href="/workshops/rustbridge">the RustBridge workshop</a> instead.

<h4>History</h4>
<p>
  "impl Days" were established early on as a tradition of the events in the RustFest family. EuroRust, following in the same footsteps, is now trying to bring them back to life.<br>
  The name refers to the first edition that took place during the 2017 "impl Period", which later became "impl Days" and, in this EuroRust edition, "impl Room".
