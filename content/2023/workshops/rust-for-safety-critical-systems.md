<p>
  The software in automotive applications has emerged as a vital component that is continuously growing in complexity, safety, and security. One of the fundamental decisions that a developer makes is the choice of a programming language. Rust, with its capabilities in terms of memory safety and security without risking performance, has emerged as a powerful contender for safety critical applications. Rust by its capabilities is progressively being recognized as a viable supplement or even a potential replacement for traditional C/C++. This transitional shift is supported by the continuous maturation and enhancement of the Rust ecosystem within the automotive industry.

<p>All workshop participants will receive a free 3 month <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/" target="_blank">CLion</a> license valid for personal use from our friends at JetBrains.</p>
<h4>Target Audience</h4>
<p>
This workshop is designed for a broad spectrum of Rust enthusiasts with an inclination towards embedded systems, from beginners with initial bases up to experts. This workshop is for you if you already understand the major benefits of using Rust over C.
</p>
<h4>Contents</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Part 1: Introduction to Automotive</p>
    <p>Together, we will dive into the evolution of programming languages within the automotive industry, setting the ground for understanding Rust's unique advantages over other programming languages in safety-critical contexts. We will explore the concept of "safety criticality" in the automotive context and further insights of the safety standard in this domain and how code quality/reliability is achieved.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part 2: Rust in Automotive</p>
    <p>In our exploration, we will closely examine how Rust holds the potential to transform the way software is developed for automotive applications. By focusing on its unique characteristics, we will understand how Rust can pave the way for more secure, reliable, and efficient software, enhancing both the development process but also the safety and security of the application developed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part 3: Hands-on</p>
    <p>No workshop is complete without hands-on coding - we will explore practical strategies for transitioning to Rust, integrating the language as a crucial component of a safety-critical application. We will use a safety certified kernel to implement Rust applications that can be deployed in a safety-critical environment. Additionally, we will dive deeper into how Rust can be integrated within the existing ecosystem of automotive drivers.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
<p>We will send a comprehensive set of preparatory instructions. This information will be provided closer to the workshop date. While this detailed instructions are on its way, we encourage those who are new to embedded Rust to get a head start by exploring the "Embedded Rust collection" (<a href="https://github.com/rust-embedded/awesome-embedded-rust" target="_blank">https://github.com/rust-embedded/awesome-embedded-rust</a>). This will provide an excellent introduction and familiarize you with some of the concepts we will be discussing in the workshop.</p>
