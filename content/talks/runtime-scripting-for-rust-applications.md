  description = "<p>Rust is a statically typed, ahead of time compiled and memory safe programming language. But sometimes, the restrictions Rust puts on us developers can be a hindrance, for example when prototyping new application ideas or when you want your end users to be able to change your applicationâ€™s runtime behavior. Thankfully, we can embed dynamically typed scripting languages with a lower learning curve into our Rust applications to get the best of both worlds.</p><p>In this talk, we will have a look at the scripting languages available to the Rust ecosystem and compare how well they integrate into Rust. Finally, we go through the process of embedding such a scripting runtime, Deno, into a Rust application and investigate how we can expose operations from our host applications to our scripts as well as share state between them.</p>"
