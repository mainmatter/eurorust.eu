  description = "<p>For every programmer the terminal is very important when it comes to productivity and efficiency. Using text-based user interfaces in the terminal is one of the ways of truly taking advantage of this. And what’s better than a highly performant systems programming language such as Rust for building TUIs</p>?<p>This talk aims to show how the TX (terminal experience) can be improved with the TUI tools written in Rust and gives a brief introduction to how to build TUIs using the Ratatui library.</p><p>The following questions will be answered:</p><ul><li>What is a terminal user interface (TUI) and why is it used?</li><li>How to build TUIs in Rust?</li><li>What can we build with TUIs? (example tools and workflows)</li><li>What is the future of TUIs? (the terminal is the future!)</li><p>Additionally:</p><ul><li>Why shouldn’t we build every app with electron? (i.e. what are the problems with the GUI applications?)</li><li>How common are TUIs? (statistics and TUI alternatives to GUIs)</li><li>How powerful is Rust when it comes to building TUIs?</li></ul>"
