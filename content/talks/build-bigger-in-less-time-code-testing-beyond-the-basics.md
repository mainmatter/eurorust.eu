How do they avoid falling apart due to an endless stream of bugs?</p><p>The answer: advanced testing techniques — much more than just <code>clippy</code>, unit tests, and end-to-end CI.</p><p>Better testing allows us to build bigger in less time, while minimizing bug triage and debugging needs. Let’s dig into some of those advanced techniques and see how they power the projects that we use every day!</p>"
