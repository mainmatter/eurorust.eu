  description = "<p>This panel explores the adoption of Rust in safety-critical systems, with perspectives from the microcontroller and automotive worlds. Experts from leading semiconductor companies will discuss why Rust is emerging as an alternative to C/C++ and the challenges it addresses in embedded and automotive domains, including software-defined vehicles.</p><p>The conversation will cover ecosystem realities, hybrid toolchains, RTOS integration, and certification hurdles for ASIL-grade systems. Panelists will examine the need for standardization and industry consortia, while highlighting the role of open-source initiatives and community projects in accelerating adoption. Looking ahead, they will share visions for the next decade of safety-critical Rust, strategies to convince decision-makers, and approaches to foster innovation in traditionally conservative industries.</p>"
