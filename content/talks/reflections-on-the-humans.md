  description = "<p>What do we know about the people building the Rust ecosystem? This talk presents key insights from a data-driven study that investigates whether Rust’s core contributors reflect the diversity of its global community. Through pull request data and contributor demographics, this research identifies areas where the community is thriving and where it is falling short. This talk is based on empirical, quantitative research examining Rust as a case study of a fast-growing open-source project. It aims to inspire concrete actions that make the Rust community more welcoming, transparent, and globally representative.</p>"
