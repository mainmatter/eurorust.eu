  description = "<p>Rust helps us write reliable software by giving us safety, performance, and an excellent toolchain. But it’s often the outside of the Rust ecosystem where ambiguity creeps back in.</p><p>Nix brings reliability to that outer world: the environment your project is built in, the tools it needs, and the system dependencies it expects.</p><p>Used together, they create a workflow that’s reproducible across machines, teams, and time. No more “works on my machine.”</p><p>In this talk, I’ll show you how to use Nix to manage Rust toolchains, system libraries, builds, and CI, without resorting to containers or brittle scripts.</p><p>Get ready to dive into reproducible, declarative dev environments. (Fair warning: you might not want to go back).</p>"
