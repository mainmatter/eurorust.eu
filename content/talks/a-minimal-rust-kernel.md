  description = "<p>Most software-engineers work in a high-level world - yet some of them are interested in how things work under the hood. In this talk, I briefly show how you can create an minimal kernel in Rust with a driver for the QEMU debugcon device to connect the power of core::fmt with the terminal.</p><p>With this talk, I’m targeting everyone that wants to understand how to create a small kernel in Rust, how accessing hardware works, and how easy we can connect the Rust formatting library (core::fmt) with a (virtual) hardware device. This is for everyone that wants to start with low-level development.</p>"
