  description = "<p>Software in cars has a bad reputation. People who love cars think it is too intangible and hard to tinker on, and for people who love software it is too obscure and badly documented.</p><p>Rust helps us get to that sweet spot in the middle, where we can actually write meaningful software that interacts with a vehicle along with the developer experience Rust provides.</p>"
