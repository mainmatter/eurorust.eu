  description = "<p>Dylint is a tool for running Rust lints from dynamic libraries. Dylint is similar to Clippy, but whereas Clippy runs a predetermined, static set of lints, Dylint runs lints from user-specified, dynamic libraries. Thus, Dylint allows developers to maintain their own personal lint collections.</p>"
