  description = "<p>Rust prides itself on performance and safety, but even in Rust, our intuition about what code is “fast” can often mislead us. This interactive talk challenges common performance assumptions using real-world Rust examples—and lets the audience guess which implementation is faster before revealing actual benchmark results.</p><p>From iterator chains to memory allocations, and from seemingly trivial operations to architecture-sensitive surprises, each case study will illuminate why benchmarking should guide our optimization efforts.</p><p>You’ll leave with:<br/>• A sharper sense of where performance bottlenecks can really hide in Rust code.<br/>• Practical examples you can take back to your own projects.<br/>• A new appreciation for performance tooling in Rust</p><p>Whether you’re optimizing a backend service or contributing to a low-level crate, this session will test your instincts, and your name might just top the live leaderboard!</p>"
