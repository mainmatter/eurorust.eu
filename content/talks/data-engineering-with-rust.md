  description = "<p>Data engineering has long been the domain of JVM-based and Python ecosystems—think Apache Spark, Hadoop, and pandas. Rust’s performance, safety, and growing ecosystem now make it an ideal choice for building high-throughput, low-latency data pipelines. In this talk, you’ll learn how to harness crates like <code>arrow-rs</code>, <code>datafusion</code>, and <code>delta-rs</code> to ingest, transform, store, and query large datasets entirely in Rust. We’ll explore real-world examples, benchmark comparisons against traditional tools, and best practices for architecting robust, production-ready pipelines..</p>"
