      Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of
      gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
      ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices.</p><br><p>We do not tolerate harassment of conference
      participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including
      talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be
      sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.

    <p>
      Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual
      orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual
      images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording,
      sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images,
      activities, material or otherwise create a sexualized environment.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      If an attendee engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate,
      including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact
      a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified by their badges.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Conference staff will be happy to help attendees and assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the
      duration of the conference. We value your attendance.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      We expect participants to follow these rules at the conference and conference-related social events.
