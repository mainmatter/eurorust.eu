  bio = "<p>I’m a Rust programmer in my late twenties based in Germany, passionate about software engineering—especially in the Rust ecosystem. Over the past years, I’ve dedicated hundreds of hours to personal and open-source projects, including contributions to the Rust OSDev organization. My main interests lie in low-level systems development: device drivers, firmware, operating systems, and virtualization. I’ve hacked on (distributed) web applications, command-line tools, and similar areas—but those aren’t my daily focus.</p><p>Since graduating in 2022, I’ve been working full-time at Cyberus Technology, where I continue to deepen my expertise in systems programming. Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, going to concerts, and value open, inclusive, and healthy work environments. You can find some of my thoughts and projects on my blog.</p>"
