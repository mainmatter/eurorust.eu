  bio = "<p>I am a curious software engineer with an interest in foreign languages and continuous learning. This is the first Rust conference I participate in as a speaker (and as an attendant). I would very much value the opportunity to show my research to a wider audience and continue working in the field, hopefully as part of a PhD :)</p>"
