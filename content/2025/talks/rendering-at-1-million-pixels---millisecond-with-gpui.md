  description = "<p>Modern computers are *fast*, but modern software rarely pushes it to its limits. We'll talk about Zed's graphics framework (GPUI) and how it enables you to build a cross-platform application, in Rust, that can render a new frame to the entire screen every 8ms. The programming model is similar to React, where UI is expressed as a declarative tree, but instead of clunking along in Javascript, it's powered by a blazingly fast rendering pipeline built from scratch in Rust.</p>"
