  description = "<p>The type system of Rust is one of its main selling points. Users rely on it being correct, expressive, and performant.</p><p>We currently sometimes fail to uphold these requirements even as many maintainers have been steadily improving it over the last 10 years.There are still many rough edge cases, difficult to support features, and performance pitfalls. To tackle all of these issues, a more significant change is needed. For this, the Types Team has have been working on a replacement of its core component for the last few years: the next-generation trait solver.</p><p>The talk explores the reasons it exists, the largest challenges, as well as the status quo and the remaining future work.</p>"
