Since then, it has become his daily driver - and he leverages that knowledge to help Helsing’s new-joiners pick up Rust for the first time in our Infraduction programme." }

In this workshop, you’ll be combining computer vision, control theory, and a healthy dosage of Rust, to play a Helsing-edition of Simon-says, using real cameras and vehicles!<br /><br />Every 30 seconds, the server will issue a new command - who can get their vehicle into the targeted quadrant the fastest?"
